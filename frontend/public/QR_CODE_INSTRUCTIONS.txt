PAYMENT QR CODE SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

To complete the subscription feature, you need to add your payment QR code:

1. Generate your UPI QR code from your payment app (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.)
2. Save the QR code image as "payment-qr.png"
3. Place it in the frontend/public/ folder
4. The image should be clear and scannable
5. Recommended size: 500x500 pixels or larger

Alternative:
- If you don't have a QR code yet, users will see a UPI ID placeholder
- Update the UPI ID in frontend/src/SubscriptionPopup.js (line 73)
- Replace "your-upi@bank" with your actual UPI ID

Contact Email:
- The contact email "healthtracker.tp@gmail.com" is already configured
- This appears on the home page and subscription popup

Cloudinary Setup:
- Update backend/.env with your Cloudinary credentials:
  * CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
  * CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
  * CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
- Get these from: https://cloudinary.com/console
